# BUILD JOURNEY RULE (Project Journal)

## Goal
Maintain a durable, human-readable build journal that captures:
- what we built
- why we built it
- key decisions/tradeoffs
- what changed (with file paths)
- what we learned (bugs, surprises, constraints)
So this can later be transformed into a “journey” writeup (blog/book/case study).

## Journal file location
Use this single canonical file:
- `docs/journey/JOURNEY.md`

If it does not exist, create it with the “Journal Bootstrap Template” below.

## When to write
After ANY of these:
- shipping a feature, endpoint, UI screen, integration
- refactor that changes structure/architecture
- bug fix that required investigation
- notable decision (tool choice, data model, approach)
- performance/security/reliability changes
- adding/removing dependencies or config changes

## What to do every time
1) Implement the requested work.
2) Update `docs/journey/JOURNEY.md` by APPENDING a new entry at the bottom.
3) Keep entries crisp, factual, and useful—no fluff.

## Entry format (append exactly)
Use this structure for each entry:

### YYYY-MM-DD (Day) — <short title>
**Time:** HH:MM (local)  
**Context:** 1–2 sentences on what prompted this work.  
**Objective:** What “done” means.

**What changed**
- <bullet describing change> (`path/to/file.ext`)
- <bullet describing change> (`path/to/file.ext`)

**Decisions**
- Decision: <what we chose>
  - Why: <reasoning / constraint>
  - Alternatives: <what we considered>

**Gotchas / Debugging notes (if any)**
- Symptom:
- Root cause:
- Fix:
- Prevention (optional):

**Verification**
- How we verified (tests, manual steps, commands run)
- Result (pass/fail + any notes)

**Next steps**
- [ ] <one concrete next step>
- [ ] <another>

**Narrative nugget (keep it human)**
2–4 sentences capturing the “moment”: the tension, tradeoff, surprise, or learning—written plainly, not hype.

## Rules of the road
- Always include file paths for non-trivial changes.
- If you’re unsure what changed, quickly scan git diff (or describe uncertainty explicitly).
- Don’t invent metrics, results, or “verification” you didn’t actually do.
- Keep the journal additive—never rewrite old entries unless correcting an error (and if you do, note it).

## Journal Bootstrap Template (create if missing)
# Build Journey

A running log of what we built, why we built it, and what we learned—written so it can later become a narrative.

## Index (optional)
- Add links here if the file gets long.
